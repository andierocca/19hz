# 19hz
http://19hz.info is a calendar for electronic music events in several cities.
Because events have shifted to being broadcasted on facebook, I see it as necessary for
event listings to be accessible to people who either choose not to take part in social media
or those who do not see the wide range of events in their area (or areas they're visiting).

Right now I'm just working on pulling that data from facebook (eventscraper.py).

In the future, we would like to pull data such as ticket pricing and age limit from either event descriptions
or ticket sales websites (eventbrite, ticketmaster, livenation, etc.).

If you would like to get involved in the development of the website or promotion
please contact me (rocca.andie@gmail.com) or Franklin (franklinjen@gmail.com).
